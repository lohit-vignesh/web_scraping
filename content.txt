Cloud Cost Vision
Home Cloud Cost Vision














Have constant watch of your cost of cloud 















 Cloud cost wastage is the biggest problem because it can cost companies billions of dollars each year. “A 2023 study by Gartner found that 30% of cloud spend is wasted, which means that companies are throwing away $147 billion per year”.There are a number of reasons why cloud cost wastage occurs, including: Overprovisioning: This is when companies allocate more resources than they need to their applications. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a lack of visibility into resource usage or a desire to have a buffer in case of unexpected demand spikes.Idle resources: This is when companies pay for resources that they are not using. This can happen if companies do not shut down unused resources or if they do not have a good process for decommissioning resources that are no longer needed.Inefficient pricing: Companies may be paying too much for cloud resources if they are not using the right pricing model or if they are not taking advantage of discounts and committed use agreements.Lack of visibility: Companies may not be aware of how much they are spending on the cloud or where their money is going. This can make it difficult to identify and address areas of waste.Cloud cost wastage can have a significant impact on a company’s bottom line. It can also lead to performance problems and security vulnerabilities. 







 















Optimize your Cloud Cost with our help 



 



















Consumption Reports 



BU wise budgets and consumption reports of major components: These reports can help you to identify which BUs are spending the most on cloud resources and which components are driving the most costs. This information can be used to target your optimization efforts and to hold BUs accountable for their cloud spending. 







Wastage Reports 



Wastage Report (including Unutilized capacity, Untagged resources, Unattached resources, Unused reserved instances): This report can help you to identify and eliminate specific areas of cloud cost wastage. For example, you can use this report to identify unutilized instances that can be downsized or eliminated, untagged resources that can be tagged and monitored, and unused reserved instances that can be returned to the cloud provider. 











Alerts 



 Budget Alerts: These alerts notify you when your cloud spending reaches a certain threshold. You can set budget alerts for individual BUs, cloud components, or your overall cloud spend. Anomaly alerts: These alerts notify you when your cloud spending or resource usage deviates from normal patterns. This can be helpful for identifying unexpected spikes in costs or usage. Wastage alerts: These alerts notify you about specific areas of cloud cost wastage, such as unutilized capacity, untagged resources, unattached resources, and unused reserved instances. Threshold alerts: These alerts notify you when a specific metric, such as CPU usage or storage utilization, reaches a certain threshold. This can be helpful for identifying potential performance problems or security vulnerabilities.

Establishing a unified approach for Infrastructure and Application Monitoring 











Observability is essential for betterment of Customer Experience 







 One of the current problems in distributed systems in the cloud that is making observability across the entire system more important is the increasing complexity and dynamism of these systems. In the past, distributed systems were typically monolithic, meaning that they were composed of a single, large piece of software. This made them relatively easy to observe, as all of the components of the system were in one place. However, modern distributed systems are typically composed of many smaller, microservices-based components.These components may be distributed across multiple cloud providers and may be constantly changing. This makes it much more difficult to observe the system as a whole. Another problem is the increasing use of containers to deploy and manage distributed systems. Containers are isolated environments that run on top of a shared operating system. This isolation makes it difficult to collect telemetry data from containers, as the data is often not visible to the outside world.  







 















How we enable your journey with Observability 



 











Need for Observability 



All of these factors are making observability across distributed systems in the cloud more important. Observability is essential for identifying and resolving performance problems, debugging code, and understanding how the system is behaving.Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks: Observability data can be used to identify performance bottlenecks across the entire system, including in containers and serverless applications. This information can then be used to optimize the code or infrastructure to improve performance.Debugging code: Observability data can be used to troubleshoot code in individual microservices, even if they are distributed across multiple cloud providers. This can help to reduce the time it takes to fix bugs.Understanding system behavior: Observability data can be used to understand how the system is behaving under load, how new changes are impacting the system, and how users are interacting with the system. This information can be used to improve the system’s performance, reliability, and scalability. 







Our Observability approach 



How Bootlabs can help you in building your Observability approach is as follows:Use a cloud-native observability platform: A cloud-native observability platform can collect and analyze telemetry data from all of the different components of a distributed system, including containers and serverless applications.Implement distributed tracing: Distributed tracing allows you to track the flow of requests through a distributed system, even if the requests are processed by multiple microservices. This can help you to identify performance bottlenecks and troubleshoot problems.Use metrics and logs: Metrics and logs are essential for observability. Metrics provide quantitative data about the system’s performance, while logs provide qualitative data about the system’s behavior.Monitor your system under load: It is important to monitor your system’s performance under load to identify any potential bottlenecks. You can use load testing tools to simulate load on your system.Use alerts and dashboards: Alerts and dashboards can help you to stay on top of your system’s health and to be notified of any problems quickly.

Secure your workflow in a simple way 















Thoroughly Assess Every Aspect of Your Applications 



  Securing a web asset is contingent upon a profound understanding of its presence. In instances where organizations manage an extensive portfolio of web assets, the potential to lose track of some is an inherent risk, rendering them susceptible to potential cyber threats. Acquire all-encompassing visibility into the entirety of your applications, including those that may have inadvertently slipped from your radar, been relegated to obscurity, or concealed intentionally.  Execute exhaustive scans across a diverse spectrum of web applications, web services, and web APIs, spanning the realms of both first-party and third-party (open source) code. This process remains agnostic to the underlying technology, framework, or programming language used in their creation.  







 







 











 







Enhanced Coverage, Reduced Risk 



Conventional application security testing solutions often rely solely on a single scanning type. Whereas need is the consolidated report of SAST + SCA + DAST & Container Scan.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) report provides a comprehensive analysis of code vulnerabilities. It identifies and evaluates potential security issues in source code, enabling proactive mitigation strategies for development teams. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) report offers insights into open-source components within a codebase. It identifies vulnerabilities, licenses, and dependencies, ensuring proactive management of third-party software risks in development projects. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) report examines web applications in real-time. It identifies vulnerabilities by simulating attacks, providing actionable insights to secure applications and protect against potential security threats. Container Scan report analyzes containerized environments for security vulnerabilities. It identifies risks within container images, dependencies, and configurations, enabling proactive measures to enhance the security posture of containerized applications. 



















Integrate Security Seamlessly into Development Workflow 



Addressing vulnerabilities post-deployment can trigger a cascade of issues: Release delays, convoluted debugging, and strained relationships between security and development teams. We offers a solution by embedding security seamlessly into the tools and daily workflows of developers. Provide developers with immediate, automated feedback, fostering a culture of writing more secure code and ultimately reducing the occurrence of vulnerabilities over time. Identify vulnerabilities at an early stage within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), thereby averting the time, costs, and complexities associated with post-release security challenges. Streamline processes and alleviate friction between development and security teams by empowering developers to independently manage security tasks 







 



















 







Continuous Security: A Year-Round Shield 



In the realm of swift deployments, vulnerabilities can persist before being detected by periodic scans, bug bounty initiatives, or manual penetration tests. You can now maintain a continuous state of security with unceasing security functionalities. Mitigate the risk of delays and limit the introduction of vulnerabilities through ongoing scans and security assessments integrated into your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Receive automated alerts when deployed technologies become outdated, all without necessitating a new scan, safeguarding the security of your applications. Minimize your risk footprint, even in Agile or rapid deployment scenarios, ensuring your security remains robust throughout the year.

Application Development
Home Application Development


















 In the dynamic world of cloud-based application development, efficiency is the linchpin. In this blog, we’ll explore strategies to expedite development processes, improve efficiency, and deliver top-notch applications in the cloud. We’ll delve into practical insights and provide relevant code examples where applicable. Efficiency in Cloud Application Development Efficiency is the cornerstone of successful cloud application development. Here are some strategies to supercharge your cloud-based projects: Serverless Architecture: Embrace serverless computing to offload infrastructure management. This allows you to focus on code and functionality while the cloud provider handles scaling and maintenance. Containerization: Leverage containerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes. They facilitate consistent deployment and scaling, making it easier to manage complex cloud applications.  Microservices: Adopt a microservices architecture to break your application into smaller, manageable components. This promotes modularity and accelerates development, as each microservice can be developed and scaled independently. DevOps and Automation: Implement DevOps practices and automation tools to streamline development, testing, and deployment. This results in faster and more reliable application releases. Managed Services: Utilize cloud providers’ managed services for common functionalities. For instance, you can leverage managed databases, authentication services, and AI/ML capabilities to save time and effort. Efficiency is paramount in cloud-based application development. By adopting strategies like serverless architecture, containerization, microservices, DevOps, and leveraging managed services, you can accelerate your development, enhance code quality, and deliver top-tier applications in the cloud more efficiently.

The AI model learns to associate text descriptions with specific visual features. When you provide a text prompt to the AI model, it uses this knowledge to generate an image that matches your description.How to create effective text promptsWhen creating text prompts, it is important to be as specific and descriptive as possible. The more information you can provide to the AI model, the better it will be able to generate an image that matches your vision.  







 







Here are some tips for creating effective text prompts:Use clear and concise language.Avoid using abstract concepts. Instead, focus on concrete nouns and adjectives.Use specific details to describe the image you want to generate. For example, instead of saying “a cat,” say “a black cat with white paws sitting on a red couch.”You can also use reference images to help the AI model understand what you are looking for.Here are some examples of effective text prompts:A photorealistic image of a black cat sitting on a red couch.A painting of a woman with long flowing hair standing on a beach at sunset.A concept art illustration of a futuristic cityscape.A cartoon drawing of a dog chasing a squirrel.Once you have created a text prompt, you can submit it to an AI image generation service. There are a number of different services available, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to experiment with different services to find one that works best for you. Here are some popular AI image generation services:DALL-E 2ImagenPartiCraiyonOnce you have submitted your text prompt to an AI image generation service, it will take a few minutes for the service to generate an image. Once the image is generated, you can download it and share it with others.Experimentation is keyThe best way to learn how to use text-based image prompting is to experiment. Try different prompts and see what kind of results you get. Don’t be afraid to get creative. The more you experiment, the better you will become at creating effective prompts.ConclusionText-based image prompting is a powerful new tool that can be used to create a wide variety of visual content.

Unleashing the Power of ELK Stack
Home Unleashing the Power of ELK Stack














 By: John Abhilash / December 1, 2023








Unleashing the Power of ELK Stack: A Complete Guide to Log Management and Data Analysis on Kubernetes 











 In today’s data-driven landscape, businesses are constantly generating vast amounts of log data. This treasure trove of information holds immense potential for unlocking insights, identifying trends, and making informed decisions. However, effectively managing and analyzing this data can be a daunting task. Fortunately, the ELK stack, comprising Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, has emerged as a powerful solution for log management and data analysis.Elasticsearch, the search and analytics engine at the heart of the ELK stack, provides a scalable and distributed platform for storing and indexing log data. Logstash, the data processing pipeline, empowers you to collect, transform, and enrich log data before sending it to Elasticsearch. Kibana, the user interface and visualization tool, provides a comprehensive dashboard for exploring and visualizing log data, extracting meaningful insights.To fully harness the power of the ELK stack, Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration platform, emerges as an ideal deployment environment. Kubernetes simplifies the task of managing the ELK stack, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resource optimization. Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, further streamlines the deployment process, making it easier to install, configure, and manage the ELK stack components.This comprehensive guide will delve into the intricacies of setting up the ELK stack with Filebeat on Kubernetes using Helm for logging. We’ll cover the prerequisites, installation steps, configuration details, and Kibana exploration, empowering you to effectively harness the power of log data.Prerequisites: Preparing the FoundationBefore embarking on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:Kubernetes Cluster: A functioning Kubernetes cluster accessible via kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.Helm: Helm installed and configured on your system. Helm simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes applications.Filebeat Deployment: Filebeat deployed on your systems to collect log data. Filebeat acts as a log shipper, gathering log data from various sources.Installing the ELK Stack: Bringing the Components TogetherWith the prerequisites fulfilled, let’s embark on installing the ELK stack using Helm:Add Helm Repository: Add the Elastic Helm repository to your system using the following command:Bashhelm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.coThis command ensures Helm can access the latest ELK stack charts.Install Elasticsearch: Install Elasticsearch using the following command:Bashhelm install elasticsearch elastic/elasticsearchThis command creates a Kubernetes deployment for Elasticsearch, ensuring a cluster of Elasticsearch pods is running. Elasticsearch pods handle storing and indexing log data.Install Kibana: Install Kibana using the following command:Bashhelm install kibana elastic/kibanaThis command creates a Kubernetes deployment for Kibana, providing a user interface for data visualization and analysis. Kibana provides a dashboard for exploring log data.Configuring Filebeat to Send Logs to Elasticsearch: Enabling Seamless Data FlowTo successfully collect and forward logs to Elasticsearch, configure Filebeat as follows:Filebeat Configuration File: Locate the Filebeat configuration file, typically named filebeat.yml. This file contains Filebeat’s configuration settings.Elasticsearch Output: Add the following output configuration to the file:YAMLoutput.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["<elasticsearch-pod-ip>:<elasticsearch-port>"]
  index: "filebeat-*"Replace <elasticsearch-pod-ip> with the IP address of one of your Elasticsearch pods and <elasticsearch-port> with the Elasticsearch port, typically 9200. This configuration instructs Filebeat to send log data to Elasticsearch.Restart Filebeat: Restart Filebeat to apply the new configuration. This ensures Filebeat starts sending log data to Elasticsearch.Accessing Kibana: Unveiling the Data Visualization DashboardOnce Elasticsearch and Kibana are up and running, you can access the Kibana dashboard using the following steps:Retrieve Kibana Service URL: Use the following command to get the service URL for Kibana:Bashkubectl get service kibana-deployment -n <namespace>Replace <namespace> with the namespace where Kibana is deployed. This command provides the URL to access Kibana.Access Kibana Dashboard: Copy the service URL from the output and paste it into your web browser. This will open the Kibana dashboard.Login to Kibana: Use the default credentials elastic for both username and password. This allows you to log in to Kibana.Exploring Kibana’s Treasures: Unveiling Insights from Log DataWith the ELK stack deployed and configured, the Kibana dashboard awaits, ready to unveil the insights hidden within your log data. Kibana offers a plethora of features to transform raw log data into actionable insights:Discover Patterns: Kibana’s Discover tab provides a centralized location to explore and analyze your log data.
